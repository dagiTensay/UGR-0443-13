                <h2>MSMEs in Ethiopia to access ETB 1.5 billion through nine MFIs</h2>
                <p>Thursday, July 28,2022</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Today Awash Bank signed a loan agreement with nine private commercial
                    Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) – Vision Fund, Nisir, Kendil, Metemamen,
                    Meklit, Dynamic, Wasasa, Harbu, and Peace MFI to unlock access to finance 
                    for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Ethiopia.The ETB 1.5 
                    billion agreement is facilitated through the BRIDGES Programme, which is 
                    part of the Mastercard Foundation’s Young Africa Works strategy in Ethiopia 
                    and is being implemented in partnership with First Consult.  
                    BRIDGES has facilitated the linkages process of banks to MFIs by conducting thorough due diligence of private 
                    commercial MFIs on, among other things, their risk category, debt absorption capacity, governance structure, 
                    experience in financing against movable collateral, and branch network. BRIDGES also provides technical support
                    to MFIs in their loan utilization efforts, monitoring whether they have lent the loan against movable collateral 
                    and providing other technical support, such as financial product development and portfolio management training for 
                    the effective utilization of the fund from banks.
