            <h1>About us</h1>
            <p>
                Our consulting business is focused on two areas. 
                First, we aim to elevate the operations of Ethiopian 
                businesses to match those in the developed world - 
                one that is driven by data, based on technology, 
                and focused on the customer. Second, we want to 
                guide foreign companies who wish to do business in Ethiopia.
                We understand the Ethiopian business environment and what the 
                pain points are for outside companies.
